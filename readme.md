# School of Solana - Season 7

I am thrilled to have successfully completed the School of Solana - Season 7, an incredible journey that significantly enhanced my knowledge of Solana blockchain development and Rust programming. This course was a fantastic challenge, pushing me to deepen my understanding of decentralized technologies through hands-on, practical training. The curriculum was designed to foster real-world skills, enabling me to build meaningful and functional programs on the Solana blockchain. The SolRaiser project, along with its associated tasks, provided an invaluable opportunity to apply theoretical concepts to practical development, resulting in a robust learning experience.

## SolRaiser Project

The SolRaiser project is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the Solana blockchain, designed to enable secure and transparent fundraising campaigns. Developed in Rust, SolRaiser allows users to create campaigns, contribute funds, and manage payouts efficiently, leveraging Solana’s high-throughput and low-cost transactions. Key features include:
- **Campaign Creation**: Users can initialize campaigns with customizable goals and deadlines, stored securely on-chain.
- **Contributions**: Contributors can send funds to campaigns using Solana’s native token (SOL), with all transactions recorded transparently.
- **Payouts and Refunds**: Successful campaigns can withdraw funds, while failed campaigns automatically refund contributors, ensuring trust.
- **Security**: The program incorporates secure account management and validation using program-derived addresses (PDAs) to prevent unauthorized access.

This project was a culmination of the skills learned throughout the course, combining Rust programming, Solana’s account model, and client-side interactions to create a fully functional decentralized application (dApp).
